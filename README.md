# Inspiration
Studying alone at a library or even public spaces may make you feel more effective or even more productive. However, while studying, we are faced with confussion, dilemas or even loneliness. This made us address common situation of students that **have anxiety for asking question** to to professors, teaching assistant, friends, or even people that you don't even know if they can answer the questions. 

Our team also set a bigger perspective on **lack of communication and connection** that happens on our community which in fact provides opportunity to develop students not just as a student but as a community. 

# What it does
Luguu came as a platform for students to **find their buddies for studying and connecting everyone** from every levels and every majors. We believe by having Luguu, we can engange students from different major and levels to know each other, asiding their ego and end up with knowing new people and gaining knowledge at the same time. 

On the other hand, Luguu also **mantain users' privacies** but also mantain **users' connection**  with others. 

# What makes us "different"
Students may end up **stuck upon those questions** and got bigger impact on their studies, grades, or even **lack of communication and connection** with their surroundings. Luguu provides create a ** high integrity learning community** which embraces connection and knowledge with others. 

# How we built

For the design, Figma is the application that we use to design all the layout and give a smooth transitions between frames. While working on the UI, developers started to code the function to make the application work. The application itself is written in Java using Android Studio.

# Challenges we ran into
There are a lot challenges that we faced while building Luguu. We tend to make Luguu as simple as possible for mentors and mentees while mantaining their effectiveness on both sides. Constructing a user friendly interfaces had also been a challenge to keep all the datas compact and clear for the user. For the developers, some of our computers lack the specification requirements to run certain development softwares properly,
so we have to frequently use others machine which are more capable.

# Accomplished that we proud of

Creating Luguu with an engaging but fun mood at the same time has showed the vision and mission of Luguu through its user interface. We are proud to be able to make this app given that most of us had never used most the technologies that we used in this app like using Android Studio and connecting it to Firebase.

# What we learned

Creating Luguu had been an unexpected journey from us. We have definietly improved as a developer and designer in both hard and soft skills. Being able to work together on different time zones improved our communication and organizational skills as a team. On the other hand, we also improved to learn new concepts and ideas, and getting accustomed to be more familiar with what we have learned before. CuHacks had made us develop not only as a developer or designer but also as a person. 

# What's next for Luguu
Luguu will actively develop as a platform to stregthen its vision and mission to create a highly integrity learning space by connecting and helping students with their community. We as a team would love to add more features including: 
- Incentives for tutoring, using point system and milestones to redeem for prizes
- Integrating Google Maps API for automatic checking of tutors and tutees near the user
- Adding new authentication methods using Google, Facebook, Github
- Implementing a chat system on the contact page, so users can directly communicate in the app
- Implementing a "study buddy feature". A group can make postings to work together with a tutor
